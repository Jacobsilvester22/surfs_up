SQLite Database evaluating the weather in Oahu, HI for surfing conditions.
## Overview 
Mr. Avy was extremely impressed by our original analysis and was able to present it recently to his share holders. He is looking to continue as planned, but asked for one last comparison from us. He is looking specifically how the temperature compares in June versus December on Oahu helpping him understand how sustainable this business will be during the two weather extremes.

* June's average temperature is 4 degrees warmer than December's
* June's lowest temperature is 8 degrees warmer than December's
* June's highest temperature is 2 degrees warmer than December's
## Summary
Overall, we see that June has warmer temperatures than December. This should not be a problem though, as both month's maximum temperature is nearaly the same. There will be plenty of customers willing to buy ice cream year round and the temperature should not be a factor in reasons why they would not. I would further like to suggest to Mr. Avy that overall percepitation between these two months should be evaluated further as well as if there are certain patterns to percipitaion locations on Ohau throughout the year, where potential in the future a second shop would be open across the island.
